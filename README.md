# heliorandom
Python proof-of-concept code to seed pseudorandom number generators with solar image data from the helioviewer API using Solar Dynamics Observer's Atmospheric Imaging Array instrument. The concept is based on the idea that high-cadence, high-resolution images of the surface of the Sun are about as excellent an example of a high-entropy source of seeds as you will be able find, at least on our solar system.
